# Installing Go

The most recent version of Go is 1.21 (January 2024).
Go 1.22 is expected in February 2024.
If your system already comes with a version of Go, you may check your version like this:

```sh
go version
```

We recommend installing the latest version of Go; you will need at least Go 1.21 for the labs in this course.

The Go team provides install instructions for the most common platforms on the [Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

To get started with Go, you should read the [Getting Started](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started) tutorial on the Go website.

If the above instructions do not work for you, please ask the TA for help.
